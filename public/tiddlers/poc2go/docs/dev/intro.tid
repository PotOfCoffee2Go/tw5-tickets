!!!Developers

All the source for both the server and TiddlyWiki front-end are on GitHub at [[PotOfCoffee2Go/tw5-tickets|https://github.com/PotOfCoffee2Go/tw5-tickets]]. The default TiddlyWiki delivered to the browser is 'public/search.html'. Also, the 'public/index.html' directs which TiddlyWiki is delivered by default.

You can run the TW5 Ticket server on your local machine that has [[git|https://git-scm.com/]] and [[node.js|https://nodejs.org]] installed. The more difficult part is to keep the your ticket database up to date.

The site is part of an experiment of building a TiddlyWiki that interacts with an [[express|http://expressjs.com/]] server. Tiddlers exist both in the TiddlyWiki .HTML file as well as the server.

The idea is the server delivers tiddlers, assets, and rarely web pages. This is done using HTTP and [[socket.io|https://socket.io]] which allows a more flexible interface between server and browser.
