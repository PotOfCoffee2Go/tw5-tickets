!!! Installation

Back to <$button actions="<<installPage>>" >Install Page</$button>.

See [[tw5-tickets|https://github.com/PotOfCoffee2Go/tw5-tickets]] on GitHub for directions on installing and starting the server.

Drag and drop the tiddlers from the `public/tiddlers/poc2go/plugins` directory into a wiki, save wiki in the `public` directory and reload from the server at `http://localhost:8000/YourSavedName.html`.

Can access the tiddlers to search tickets by placing a button <$button actions="<<poc2go 'fetch-tostory' 'tickets/Suggest'>>">TW5 Ticket Search</$button> in a tiddler on the wiki.

`<$button actions="<<poc2go 'fetch-tostory' 'tickets/Suggest'>>">TW5 Ticket Search</$button>`

Pressing the button will bring up the Search screen/tiddler.

<hr style="opacity: .5;">
Optionally, there are supporting tiddlers that display the menu on the bottom of the tiddlers, helpful user documentation, sylesheets, and such that can be installed.

<hr style="opacity: .5;">
Application

This is the most common component. It includes all of the browser side tiddlers that contain documention, developer tips, and such.

<hr style="opacity: .5;">
Stylesheets

The stylesheets handle the display of buttons between developer and production mode, as well as visual refinements to dropdown boxes and Tix/Btx plugins.

<hr style="opacity: .5;">
Palettes

Modifications to a few palettes, mostly pertaining to dropdown boxes, which makes them display a little prettier.

<hr style="opacity: .5;">
Tiddlywiki Config

This adds `-[tag[server]]` to the list of tiddlers that will not be saved. Tiddlers tagged with 'server' come from the server so saving them in the single file wiki is not required.

<hr style="opacity: .5;">
Sidebar

This checkbox installs the 'Catacombs' tab in the sidebar which displays the tiddlers that have been installed.

<hr style="opacity: .5;">
Macros

These tiddlers are the same ones you drag and dropped above. Will require a save/reload to take effect. Includes the network interface, disables CamelCase links, and installs this 'install' tiddler. Is generally used when upgrading to a new release.

<hr style="opacity: .5;">
Splash Screen

As might guess - this is the splash screen that shows when loading the wiki. Is a good start if you wish to personalize - right now shows PotOfCoffee2Go stuff.

<hr style="opacity: .5;">
Notebook Documentation

These tiddlers are user documentation specific to the Notebook Plugin. If not using Notebook then no need to install.
